Description

<!--
# Both your title and this description are made public and displayed in the
# conference program to help attendees decide whether they are interested in
# this presentation. Limit this description to a few concise paragraphs.
-->

Audience
--------
<!--
# 1–2 paragraphs that should answer three questions: (1) Who is this tutorial
# for? (2) What background knowledge or experience do you expect students to
# have? (3) What do you expect students to learn, or to be able to do after
# attending your tutorial?
-->

Outline
-------
<!--
# Make an outline that lists the topics and activities you will guide your
# students through over the 3 hours of your tutorial. Provide timings for
# each activity — indicate when and for how long you will lecture, and when
# and for how long students will be tackling hands-on exercises. This is a
# very important criteria! Generally speaking, the more detailed the outline,
# the more confidence the committee will have that you can deliver the material
# in the allotted time.
-->

Additional notes
----------------
<!--
# (a) If you have offered this tutorial before, please provide links to the
# material and video, if possible. Otherwise, please provide links to one
# (or two!) previous presentations by each speaker. (b) Please summarize your
# teaching or public speaking experience and your experience with the subject
# of the tutorial. (c) Let us know if you have specific needs or special
# requests — for example, requests that involve accessibility, audio, or
# restrictions on when your talk can be scheduled.
